GTM Manifest — Tracking SaaS

1. ICP

We focus on foreign owners and co-owners of small F&B businesses in Bali (cafés, restaurants, dark kitchens) that critically depend on GoFood and GrabFood for daily sales.
	•	Typical structure: 1–3 outlets, each with 10–20 staff, 20–150 delivery orders/day depending on season.
	•	Management: a local operations manager is often hired, while the owner tracks profit and KPIs.
	•	Income: net profit after aggregator commissions (20–30%) and promos. Any disruption (closed status, menu errors, rating drops) directly reduces income.
	•	These owners are time-poor and cannot manually monitor accounts every few hours; they need automation.

2. Current Workflow / Jobs to be Done & Value Proposition

Current workflow:
	•	Every morning managers manually check GoBiz/GrabMerchant to ensure outlets are “open.”
	•	Menu updates are manual; “out of stock” items are added late.
	•	Reviews are checked irregularly, often days later.
	•	Staff forget to re-open after lunch/breaks, leaving outlets closed.

Real “closure” scenarios:
	•	Grab auto-closes a restaurant if an order is canceled with the reason “resto closed/busy” — even when the venue is actually open.
	•	Grab/Gojek systems can pause an outlet due to courier delays, bad weather, or lack of response to an order.
	•	A single cancellation for the “wrong reason” can put the venue into “closed for the day.”
	•	Owners complain they don’t get instant notification — they discover hours or days later they were offline.

Main pains:
	•	Direct revenue loss (each “closed” day = $70–200+ in missed orders).
	•	Dropping below 4.5★ reduces ranking and visibility.
	•	Bestsellers remain “out of stock” for days → lost orders.
	•	Owners don’t fully trust staff, but also can’t monitor constantly.

Value Proposition:
My service [TrackerDelivery] protects foreign F&B owners in Bali from hidden losses by automatically tracking status (open/closed), reviews, and menu availability — and instantly alerting on incidents.

3. Price

Calculation:
	•	Local manager salary: Rp5–8M/month ($300–500) ≈ Rp150k/hour (~$10).
	•	Owner/manager spends ≥10 hours/month on checks → $100 “labor cost.”
	•	One “closed” day = Rp1–3M ($70–200) in lost revenue.

ROI logic:
	•	Save $100 of labor + prevent revenue loss.
	•	$49/month for 3 outlets + $15 per additional outlet is justified.
	•	14-day free trial to prove value.

4. The Solution

Core features:
	1.	Open/Closed Monitoring — parses public GrabFood/GoFood pages and detects closures even when system-triggered (auto-pause, cancellations, “busy”); owner receives alerts (email/WhatsApp) within minutes.
	2.	Rating & Review Alerts — instant notifications on 1–2★ reviews with categorization (speed, packaging, taste); optional auto-replies with granted access.
	3.	Out of Stock Tracker — daily reports on unavailable dishes so owners can spot persistent staff/process errors.

Why it works:
	•	Eliminates platform “blind spots”: auto-pauses and silent closures are no longer missed.
	•	Protects revenue and peace of mind.
	•	Works across both platforms (Grab + GoFood), covering major risks.

5. Go-to-Market Motion (Sales & Marketing)
	•	Channels: Facebook expat groups (Bali Entrepreneurs, Horeca Trade), Telegram/WhatsApp owner chats, coworking spaces (Outpost, Dojo).
	•	Content marketing: articles like “How one canceled order closed a café for a day and cost $150,” “Why Grab may close your restaurant without warning.”
	•	PPC/SEO: queries such as “GrabFood closed Bali,” “GoFood restaurant not working.”
	•	Funnel: free audit (e.g., “your restaurant was closed for X hours last month”) → 14-day trial → $49 subscription.
	•	Proactive outbound (one-liner): We silently add target venues into our tracker, monitor a week for “should-be-open but closed” incidents, estimate lost revenue, find contacts via Google Maps and Grab/Gojek pages, then send a hyper-personalized pitch showing their exact downtime and likely losses.
